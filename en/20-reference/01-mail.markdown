Workflow and Search Tickets both show the same view - the same view that all tickets are displayed in. Workflow applies default filters _that cannot be changed_ in the user interface. This view is also used for custom worklists you have setup, so the functionality described below will apply to those as well.

Clicking on the `subtotals` link at the top of the view will show you the **subtotals** sidebar.

The subtotals sidebar will allow you to quickly filter the tickets in the view. On the **Workflow** tab, you can only filter by group - you can filter based on `status`, `group` (and then further by `bucket`), and `worker` on the **Search Tickets** tab.

Clicking on the `customize` link will allow you to customize the view. You can choose which columns to display, and the order of the columns, along with the number of rows to display per page.

Clicking on the `piles` link will allow you to quickly perform an action on a specific group of tickets. From this pane you can quickly move tickets to another group or bucket, assign them to a worker, close, flag as spam, or delete them. It's a very efficient way to handle a mass amount of tickets that have something in common.

Clicking on the `search` link will take you to the **Search Tickets** tab, _with the current filters automatically applied_. This allows you to quickly navigate to the **Search Tickets** page with the filters from the current list of tickets you are looking at.

Clicking on the `copy` link will allow you to copy the filters on the current view into a new worklist which you can display _wherever you want_.

Clicking the `export` link will allow you to export all of the tickets in the current view (_even the ones that are on another page_) into a CSV or XML file which will automatically be downloaded to your computer. You can select the columns you wish to export.

Clicking the `refresh` (blue circle) link will refresh the current view, adding any new tickets to it.

Clicking the `rss feed` button will create a new RSS Feed you can subscribe to. This feed is automatically updated when any tickets would appear in the view you have setup. You can view all of your RSS Feeds under the [RSS notifications tab](#rss-notifications).
